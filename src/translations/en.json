    "1":"Hello! Aside from an enthusiasm for espresso and a tinacity for tea, one could say I have a profound curiosity for code; a passion for programming (okay enough with the alliteration; this will be impossible to translate). As a third-year student (almost) at the University of Waterloo, I’ve learned to appreciate the steps that took me from Grand Cayman, to suburban Toronto, to suburban Chicagoland, to Waterloo.",
    "2":"During my foundational period in Illinois, I found joy in many creative endeavors: singing, dancing, playing the piano, drawing, painting, and (occasionally) writing; there were simply so many things to express and so many ways to do so. Later on, I began to acquire foreign languages, and use them to explore other cultures.",
    "3":"And so, it is here that I stand, frankly, wondering what the hell I’m doing. The road ahead is long, arduous, and unfamiliar. I’ll take it one step at a time; I can’t know what will stand before me, until it trips me flat on my face."
